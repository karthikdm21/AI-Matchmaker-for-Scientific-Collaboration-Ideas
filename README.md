🔍 AI-Powered Research Collaboration Recommender
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to identify potential academic collaborations by analyzing the similarity of research paper abstracts from the arXiv dataset. It aims to bridge the gap between researchers across disciplines by surfacing high-potential, interdisciplinary connections.

📌 Overview
With the overwhelming volume of academic publications, manually discovering relevant collaborators is time-consuming and often overlooks cross-domain synergies. This AI-powered system addresses that challenge by automatically analyzing paper abstracts to recommend possible collaborations—especially between researchers from different fields.

⚙️ How It Works
Data Collection
Utilizes the arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json file. A manageable sample of 1,000–5,000 entries is used for performance.

Data Preprocessing
Loads data line-by-line to handle large files efficiently. Retains only titles, abstracts, authors, and categories. Drops nulls to ensure quality.

Text Vectorization
Converts abstracts to numerical form using TF-IDF, highlighting the significance of words in context.

Similarity Computation
Computes cosine similarity between abstract embeddings to measure content-based similarity.

Interdisciplinary Matching
Identifies top similar papers for each entry. If their categories differ, the match is flagged as interdisciplinary, signaling collaboration potential.

Result Generation
Outputs a clean, styled dataframe with suggested paper pairs, their similarity scores, categories, and authors for quick review.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
TF-IDF (Scikit-learn)
Cosine Similarity
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

🔧 Optional Enhancement: Use Sentence Transformers and FAISS for semantic-aware and GPU-accelerated similarity computation.

🌟 Impact
This system streamlines the discovery of potential collaborators, especially across research domains—encouraging interdisciplinary innovation and reducing the time spent on manual literature reviews or networking. By automating abstract analysis, it enhances research efficiency and connectivity in today's data-driven academic landscape.
