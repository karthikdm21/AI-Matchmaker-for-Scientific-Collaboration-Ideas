"Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and
  LHC energies","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.

"The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field
  fluid model","  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with
tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair
wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit,"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

"Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material
  properties","  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The
  Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS","  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy
observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of
Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.

generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark

larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This
discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate

"Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in
  Quiescence","  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya
in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

Stochastic Lie group integrators,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth
finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport
along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere,"  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,
remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a

with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The

bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.

of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show
analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n
is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single
levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for
parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the
standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one
steady state.

show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under

resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error
in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave
I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not

Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a
natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a
classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then
proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)
in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on
a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity
assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal
object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth
isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct
a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold
which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the
quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups
of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum
double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of
holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.

Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods,"  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice
Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without
blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the
same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes
and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction
of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar
quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)
based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.
All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic
quasiequilibria.

"Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in
  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas","  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

"Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows
  over a gradual slope with bottom friction","  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear
periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a
variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging
method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable
equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results
on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or
intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most
commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,

definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various

manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting

curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely

"Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional

theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.

of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

"The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined

binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf
secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.

double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity

for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both

view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.

Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for
nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the

one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression
of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.
Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its
highest derivatives.
  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really
solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent
variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate
a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.

A transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem,"  We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential
geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which
implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is

harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\""ahler metric.
We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral

Injective Morita contexts (revisited),"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in
which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita
$\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local
projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in
which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the
bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita
semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will
be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories
of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.
We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and
injective right wide Morita contexts.

"Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical
  Evaporation","  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way
depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

"Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor
  Bose-Einstein Condensates","  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite
background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an
integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the
inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The
resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the
previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and
dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of
the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.

Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested
density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble
in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)
distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the
observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the
{\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained
cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological
constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages
of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within
the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the
bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble
suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,
simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of
the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.

"Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely
  cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions","  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of
clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

A Universality in PP-Waves,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas,"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of
one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles
that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.
Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles
collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass
and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the
number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our
main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on
the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states
that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of

"A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws:
  nonparametric regression","  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the
probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by
experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively
by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a

with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of

operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These
inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave
functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,
and Kosem, respectively.
  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||

similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer
exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively
in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.

Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black

Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering,"  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to
quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied
systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic
scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$,
twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit
the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon
bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon
scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark
(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the
ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)
distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark
distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and
antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively
explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron
suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark
annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the
large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet

SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of
aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer
functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in
an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film
compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and
packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.
The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by
microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest
regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.

Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet,"  We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with
nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)
  This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously
dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the
critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits
strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a
low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle
density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense
at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,
which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the
transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the
critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding
the order of the transition.

we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it
available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground

between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant
experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum

I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films,"  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been
studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H
between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V
isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show
a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down
to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in
terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may
be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.
Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled
according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent
effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the

"Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr
  spacetimes","  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a
nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory,"  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid
flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf
r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the
fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear

dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

Construction of initial data for 3+1 numerical relativity,"  This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for the
Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve the
constraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz and
enhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformal
transverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed and
illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial
data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.

"Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a
  Magnetic Field","  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond
chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0
(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with
our TMRG results.

Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data,"  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x
and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability
density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose
kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)
the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the
introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly
related variables.

Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing,"  The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent
Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$
approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number
conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal
response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A
simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number
conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the
correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is
shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum
has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The
collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual
interaction.

Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment,"  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium
selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we
demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of
the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;
more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any
mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral
functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay
branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a
quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be
part of any reliable theory.

Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM,"  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances
derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines
(CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the
interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario,
the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined
within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only
after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling
down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these
metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next
generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give
rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed
ORL-CEL discrepancy. (The full version of this work is submitted to Astronomy

Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics,"  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the
complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed
for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the
entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of
experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to
integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and
information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of
the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments
needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost
function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is
demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.

Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data,"  Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale

inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials
especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force
matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to
optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen
reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio
methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,
icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have
been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of
specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.

On smooth foliations with Morse singularities,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We
show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact
branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely
related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the
one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct
computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach
allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the
results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to
generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary
values of the superpotential couplings.

different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$)
phases.
  The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly
suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the
formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a
comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy

of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated

"Dark energy and neutrino model in SUSY -- Remarks on active and sterile
  neutrinos mixing --","  We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory.
The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the
gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was
broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the
equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It
is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of
the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on
cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed
neutrino variable.

"The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of
  sight towards HE 2347-4342","  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of
the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

Biased random walks on combs,"  We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased
random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral
dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine.
Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb
with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the
spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We
also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability
measures.

Monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups,"  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized
in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids,
called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial
functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections
with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1}
and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D
are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1
non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz
algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any
finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain
infinite generating sets.

"The Reliability on the Direction of the Incident Neutrino for the Fully

[Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumed
that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the
detected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the

we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time
Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of

physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.
  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons
under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained
under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of
the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside
the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds
irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.

Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution,"  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

"Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by
  fluctuating environment","  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of
single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.
The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing
dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.
Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity,"  In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model
for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was
able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random
networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in
the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only
for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the
Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary
connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns
out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the
average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased
functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only
functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

"Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised
  non-crossing partitions","  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and
types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter
groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a
Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a
subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation
is ""minimal"" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s,
$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these
decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$
decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a
somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$
decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on
map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.
These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and
fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le
\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions
poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block
structure"" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies
all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula,"  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star
cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42
class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the
supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should
not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar PSR J1357-6429,"  We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429

luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy
channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.
The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and
allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a

obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of
SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates
from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like
dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's
equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now
sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is

X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs

"Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding
  Matrix","  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

  and the Progenitor Supernova Explosion","  We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal
radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind
nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of
this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray
emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a
power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the
X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than
the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly
offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7
arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio
Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some
areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index
of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of
L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these
observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a
large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model
for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we
conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula
formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly
(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),
low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a
low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.

Three Particle Correlations from STAR,"  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in
central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au
collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large
angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent
energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical
flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle
correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,
conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the
dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can
be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from
QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal
correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.
Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction
of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications
of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are
discussed.

The Return of a Static Universe and the End of Cosmology,"  We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM universe
forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that
observers in our ""island universe"" will be fundamentally incapable of
determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the
highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial
origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this
epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In
this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps
fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe
was first presented.

Magnetohydrodynamic Rebound Shocks of Supernovae,"  We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining
`quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to
explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova
explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron
diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense
magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space
approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass
driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD
shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as
compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the
gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.

Exploring First Stars Era with GLAST,"  Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible
to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first

the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images.
Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of
high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST
sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on
energetics and constituents of the first stars era.

"Correlated modulation between the redshifted Fe K alpha line and the

regions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patterns

A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest
possible time-scales (few ks) using ""excess maps"" and cross-correlating light
curves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K
alpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature
between 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks
that is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source
continuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe
line and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion
disc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the

"Einstein vs Maxwell: Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in
  flat space, or both?","  Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the
gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in
a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration
tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space
cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy.
In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the
Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of
a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of
the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the
components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign,
leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is
covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the
total energy and the zero point energy vanish.

"Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive
  integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry","  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the
description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the
diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be
identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type
in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic
observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main
Belt.

The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC,"  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged
gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such
particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In
this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling
helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery
channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,
reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides
the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires
integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV
and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This
helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various
discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference
regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

"Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets:
  A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force","  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an
important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of
exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve
better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond
with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric
PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope
that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet
mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass
planets possible.
  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.
  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods
demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap
for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these

also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found
to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf

These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator,

proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the

"A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking
  (Invisibility)","  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

Non-perturbative conserving approximations and Luttinger's sum rule,"  Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of
the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically
consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as
certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for
variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the
self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.
Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under
which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.
Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site
approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the
consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are

a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3

highest visual extinction.

Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC,"  Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric
requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing
their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair
production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the
lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra
dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from
supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel
provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production
rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are
sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.

Modeling the three-point correlation function,"  We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function
(3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat
LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic
mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos
and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and
color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are
varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated
3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements
lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM
halos and subhalos.

"Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I. Resolving The Dust
  Shell Around AFGL 5440","  We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the
dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a
continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed

occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY
radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the

the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.
The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the

outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a
substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher

Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects,"  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the
formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main
predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical
perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the
evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require
better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

"Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from
  Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5","  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak
lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects
are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory
instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the
prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic
zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They
are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory
instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We
analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow
for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the
effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway
directions.

2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of
months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm
telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS
2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time

H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of

We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric

angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around

"Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary, A0620-00","  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF.
The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of
neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with
previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.
(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =
9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

"Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A

monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis

  Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674","  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of
planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includes
the

the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm

differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than

express this fact by saying that the ""mapping radius"" of S in R^n is 1.
  Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in

the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric
spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear

It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by
interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of

Common Envelope Evolution Redux,"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the
envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

"Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions
  of the thermodynamic model","  We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly.
Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen in
predictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclear
system passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are able
to pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when
they appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics
addressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in
the canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand
canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the
issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in
both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this
distribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The
relationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.

The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations,"  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using
N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these
models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial
binary content of globular clusters.

outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on
the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom
laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments
with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom

A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm,"  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event
particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.

in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the
same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference
between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering

constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping
them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations
among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not
equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these
systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of
twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical
applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.
Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A
unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in
the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the
dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in
high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as
well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper
we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.

Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger,"  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen
(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In
particular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized
post-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN
parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general
relativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is
proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN
vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the
non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By
mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the
corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point
particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that
the Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by
current and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of
Chern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.

pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high
dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly
dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which
is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is
identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of
the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a
genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for
the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent
and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is
sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within
seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates
with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive

requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E,"  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in
their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

Effect of node deleting on network structure,"  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks
has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type

with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the
galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive
black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.

Effects of Dirac sea on pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter,"  We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the
interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for
the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon
dynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)
$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via
suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect
of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the
chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is

"Spin-orbit coupling effect on the persistent currents in mesoscopic ring
  with an Anderson impurity","  Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effect
of Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in
mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect
will decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this
side-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the
persistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO
coupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt
jumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin
current circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this
system.

Probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations,"  Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional,
diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the second
space derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutions
of these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time or
variable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. This
property is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standard
diffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economical
problems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.

Fabrication of half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal,"  We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material
using state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.
To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where
SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence
states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti
substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.
This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity
in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based
technology.

investigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the

that region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field
breakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of
phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from
the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole

operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties,
which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under
small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of
elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators
defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.
We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the
Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.
When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral
instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which
can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description
of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some
numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from
their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.

turbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag
force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it
possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over
space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the
dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the
fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate
the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare
our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the
theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the
spectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results
are in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number
accessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).

On generalized entropy measures and pathways,"  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical
independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all
of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature
of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy
leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related
differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of
""inaccuracy"" is also explored.

as a function of x using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy, where
SrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surface
spectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a soft
gap. A hard gap appears at higher x values consistent with the transport
properties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermi
level, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherent
feature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with the
increase in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to be
sufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis of
the spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electron
correlation in the electronic properties of this system.

We find that at the one-loop level this model may accommodate the electroweak

place, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass when
the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker. Also, the other three
heavier neutral Higgs bosons get more large masses when the strength of the

Riesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional
reaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental
solution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization
of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and
time-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be
interpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are
expressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.

The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of

modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the

generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC)
additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupled
with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction
experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the
evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for
the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure
in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction
coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together
with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa
through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <
$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.
This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes
sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the
pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

"Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations","  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted
to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

Phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential,"  We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atom

the dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the
Debye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and
downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are
performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of
bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate
is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep
bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.
Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of
magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.
We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400
$\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the
adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the

P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the
exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is
detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type
asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property

comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.
Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher

"Spin and pseudospin symmetries and the equivalent spectra of
  relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles","  We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospin
symmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energy
spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector
and scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes
of the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When
both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for
isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper
component or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it
equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,
besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular
momentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or
lower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few
possible applications of this result.

"General asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations and phase
  transitions in quantum gravity","  We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity
with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological
singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and
unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has
quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual
anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on
the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum
gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field
correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with
quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is
interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.

Trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates,"  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.
(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses
undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars,"  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a
high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode
deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications
for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable
amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.

Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops,"  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies
and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.
Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a
development of coronal seismology.

"Pseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo
  Codes","  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel
concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than
that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can
only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards
low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a
rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we
present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to
simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the
error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an
$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this
mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on
$\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible
existence of sterile neutrinos.

"Evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole: effect
  of the black hole quadrupole","  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits
around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

Simulation of Robustness against Lesions of Cortical Networks,"  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain
will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many
properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to
their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex
networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and
functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random
(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that
have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,
hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network
analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and
macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark
rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.

"An invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions
  in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries","  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of
domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability
because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic
networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and
directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for
SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the
polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries
and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.

Photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts,"  We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the
presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement
with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large

use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the
photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the
absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for
oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is
calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential
decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a
length-independent value in the presence of radiation.

QED for fields obeying a square root operator equation,"  Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2
and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use
non-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter
equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the
correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.
By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and
taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or
for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the

Feedback from first radiation sources: H- photodissociation,"  During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources is
accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the
impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the
first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and
Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the
primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.

${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.

"Reduced phase space and toric variety coordinatizations of Delzant
  spaces","  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space
defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give
explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of
the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of
an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is
equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of
the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),
and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of
the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal
coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about
the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can
be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make
the presentation more self-contained.

We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a
treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In

Type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions,"  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,
I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional
conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The
n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are
briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.

"Broadening the Higgs Boson with Right-Handed Neutrinos and a Higher
  Dimension Operator at the Electroweak Scale","  The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open
up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed
neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs
boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are
subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic
decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.
A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced
vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed
using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel
decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental
constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question
of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the
approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.

Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star,"  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD
70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to
deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally
compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea
explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand
unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,
the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model
fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex

arbitrariness of their relative positions.

This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically
engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the
three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a

Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs,"  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in
tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these
`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their
present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we
derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In
particular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on
the torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the
threefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of
torsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.

The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and
use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale
structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of
these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

this emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the
situation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed
study of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for
the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which
interfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon
signal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for
emission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our
model for the extended emission.

Mass and Temperature of the TWA 7 Debris Disk,"  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron
around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk
around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron
flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in
the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of
disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.
debris) as a function of spectral type.

Annealed importance sampling of dileucine peptide,"  Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a
nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The
weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as
an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we
demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that
equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For
this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient
than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering
whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the
beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as
it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.
Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.

A General Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Equation and its Associated Entropy,"  A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from
a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe
phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous
diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is
characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two
distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the
stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and
introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the
H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition
rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized
entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are
discussed.

Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

Inapproximability of Maximum Weighted Edge Biclique and Its Applications,"  Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both}
positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted
edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a
bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has
various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range
of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max
\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where
$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in
\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is
$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for

system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable

competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a
general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation
rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which
predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the
new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate
of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases
accessible from it.

Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forces
are of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we find
that the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rm

long-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary when
Coulombic interactions are also present.

"Possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the cluster

of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess
emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft
excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton
observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the
position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant
azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with
models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using
the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected
properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed
properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal
interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated
with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying
population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.

metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the
radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic
simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,
led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to
the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with
metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5
Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core
reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4
Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with
metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share
most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass
proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=
10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower
limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second
generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more
massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity
dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the
kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6
solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.
Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular

"Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended

color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

"Phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres

spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that
these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

"Optimal Routing for Decode-and-Forward based Cooperation in Wireless
  Networks","  We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can
help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in
the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the
myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

$\alpha(T)/T\propto T^{-1}$ from a weaker $T^{-1/2}$ divergence. We ascribe
this change to a crossover in the dimensionality of the critical fluctuations

"Stable oscillations of a predator-prey probabilistic cellular automaton:
  a mean-field approach","  We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of
coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are
localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and the evolution of intermediate polars,"  Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magnetic
white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.
Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through
the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

hot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the
prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the
hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably
leading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the
quasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the
fractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we
fine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are
manifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper
understanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical
advantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.

generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.
Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the
long-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC
method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under

observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can
be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar
populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population
of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very
good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate
the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity
distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of
merger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity
transformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model

"Binaries, microquasars and GLAST","  Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of microquasars show
evidence for the acceleration of particles to very high energies. Signatures of
non-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also be
found. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100
MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission can
originate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar
wind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very near
future on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on the
link between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probe
pulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.

"Linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the

Abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris,

  Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we provide
a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of
automorphisms of a minimal surface.
  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational
transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its
non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,
there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,
whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is
not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.
  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite
order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.

"On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels with Degraded
  Message Sets","  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a
communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their

senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message
being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has
advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,
is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,
achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian
cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate
regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the
high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer
considerable improvements over these existing results.

$n$. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Heilbronn, Olson proved that
  $A$ is complete if $n$ is a prime and if $|A|>2\sqrt{n}.$
  Recently Vu proved that there is an absolute constant $c$, such that for an
arbitrary large $n$, $A$ is complete if $|A|\ge c\sqrt{n},$ and conjectured
that 2 is essentially the right value of $c$. We show that $A$ is complete if
$|A|> 1+2\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.

"Swift/XRT observes the fifth outburst of the periodic Supergiant Fast
  X-ray Transient IGR J11215-5952","  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005
with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

charged hard spheres with additional short-range interactions (without
electrostatic interactions the model belongs to the same universality class as
the 3D Ising model). The effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian of the full

"Mid-Infrared Fine Structure Line Ratios in Active Galactic Nuclei
  Observed with Spitzer IRS: Evidence for Extinction by the Torus","  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and
[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate
the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

"Spontaneous Lorentz Violation: Non-Abelian Gauge Fields as
  Pseudo-Goldstone Vector Bosons","  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone
vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

In-medium effects on particle production in heavy ion collisions,"  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)
cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions
($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant
relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of
bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which
determines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential
interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This
problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the
system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both
energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a
hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the
algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD
simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within
experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box
should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.
It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.

Composite fermion wave functions as conformal field theory correlators,"  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been
expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other

"On the potential of transit surveys in star clusters: Impact of
  correlated noise and radial velocity follow-up","  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi
to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,
incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the
detectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude
limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.
New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial
velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby
(<100 pc) clusters.

all s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a
member of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has
experienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is
dredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of

The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow
from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably
created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On

"Continuous interfaces with disorder: Even strong pinning is too weak in
  2 dimensions","  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective
interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions
without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs
measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.

of $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$
is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for
any compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$
reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital

Dust Formation and Survival in Supernova Ejecta,"  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of
grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

gain values can exceed $10^{4}$ cm$^{-1}$ in the 1-10 terahertz frequency
range, for electron-hole densities in the $10^{9}$-$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ range,
even when plasmon energy loss due to intraband scattering is considered.
Plasmons are found to exhibit net gain for intraband scattering times shorter
than 100 fs. Such high gain values could allow extremely compact terahertz
amplifiers and oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 $\mu$m range.

"Solving The High Energy Evolution Equation Including Running Coupling
  Corrections","  We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the
recently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105,
hep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result
of [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling
leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very
large rapidity.

"Millimeter imaging of HD 163296: probing the disk structure and
  kinematics","  We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of
the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays
both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust
properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the
observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the

analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs
bosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by
combining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on
full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM
Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios
in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM
parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM

White dwarf masses derived from planetary nebulae modelling,"  We compare the mass distribution of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN)
with those of their progeny, white dwarfs (WD). We use a dynamical method to

distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by

"Temporal Evolution of Step-Edge Fluctuations Under Electromigration
  Conditions","  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration
conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.

wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for
correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable
wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the
correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and
instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the
Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our
detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for
dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to
help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

Detecting and Characterizing Planetary Systems with Transit Timing,"  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two
goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5

increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do

Mapping the Youngest Galaxies to Redshift One,"  We describe results of a narrow band search for ultra-strong emission line
galaxies (USELs) with EW(H beta) > 30 A. 542 candidate galaxies are found in a
half square degree survey using two ~100 Angstrom 8150 A and 9140 A filters
with Subaru/SuprimeCam. Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects in
the sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727,
and H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z
< 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determine
the H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs,
which is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1,
suggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these
redshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines
and about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor
Galaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield
rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.
The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06
(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The
luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent
with the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest
that galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <
1.

Discovery of extreme asymmetry in the debris disk surrounding HD 15115,"  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk
surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the
optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable
property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme
length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,
whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to
near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain
scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a
large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in
the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics
alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical
perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115
that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic
space velocity, and age.

The Mathematical Universe,"  I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that
there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans.

MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible
representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to
broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness.
I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures
exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why
our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation
between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical

Testing String Theory with CMB,"  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB
observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.

Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model,"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies,"  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths
of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

Exploring the Variable Sky with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a
catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS
Stripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz
system for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we
compute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and
study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter
than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g
and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)
quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted
flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar
locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like
behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo
substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to
expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that
it will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million
low-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

"The Boundary Conditions of the Heliosphere: Photoionization Models

and composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties

transfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation
field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray
background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and
the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible
range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to
radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the
heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to
constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the
observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)
and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron
density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-
0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with
sub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however
C is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and
partially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and
X(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are
found for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low

Long Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors: Boundary Conditions and Binary Models,"  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type
Ic supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which
the GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive
star to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies
suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the
collapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star
models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive
helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during
core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few
millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent
evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the
strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain
sufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.

"Multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched
  dry DNA","  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch
elastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These
distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.

J/psi Production in an Equilibrating Partonic System,"  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then
expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included
here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of
transverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and
LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the
partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a
bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and
the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon
collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an
indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the
rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be

object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the
scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant
mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$

to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into
account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized

Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment within Dark Matter Halos,"  Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment
within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group
galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment
between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its
BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its
satellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies
are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7
Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the
direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are
perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \Rvir, we
find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites
and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.

"Proto-Neutron Star Winds, Magnetar Birth, and Gamma-Ray Bursts","  We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron
star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we
then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for
both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important
multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue
that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce
relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities,
timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for
producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

A very massive runaway star from Cygnus OB2,"  Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 to
investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

Optical spectrum of the post-AGB star HD56126 in the region 4010-8790 AA,"  We studied in detail the optical spectrum of the post-AGB star HD56126

of the radial velocities measured from spectral features of different

"Generation of Large Number-Path Entanglement Using Linear Optics and
  Feed-Forward","  We show how an idealised measurement procedure can condense photons from two
modes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, it
is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only
one mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basic
procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\""{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include
quantum imaging and metrology.

Finite branch solutions to Painleve VI around a fixed singular point,"  Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed
singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution
is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.
The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,
Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,
resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic
differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify
all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.

"An Inverse $f(R)$ Gravitation for Cosmic Speed up, and Dark Energy
  Equivalent","  To explain the cosmic speed up, brought to light by the recent SNIa and CMB
observations, we propose the following: a) In a spacetime endowed with a FRW
metric, we choose an empirical scale factor that best explains the
observations. b) We assume a modified gravity, generated by an unspecified
field lagrangian, $f(R)$. c) We use the adopted empirical scale factor to work
back retroactively to obtain $f(R)$, hence the term `Inverse $f(R)$'. d) Next
we consider the classic GR and a conventional FRW universe that, in addition to
its known baryonic content, possesses a hypothetical `Dark Energy' component.
We compare the two scenarios, and find the density, the pressure, and the
equation of the state of the Dark Energy required to make up for the
differences between the conventional and the modified GR models.

to understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission
occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct
information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical
properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the
SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine}
the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in
the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond
resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO
v=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0
J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other
oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting
regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the
central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther
shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R
Leo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the
different maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.

Partially disordered state near ferromagnetic transition in MnSi,"  The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ reveals
existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the
magnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to
the non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by
the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the
spin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and
$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition
between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign
means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a
destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state
below the first order ferromagnetic transition.

namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.

straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several
different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the
different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between
them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the
weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of
the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm
of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study
revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative

that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which
is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$
sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that
the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the
outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related
model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a
Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total
mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi
r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the
outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne

Fuzzballs with internal excitations,"  We construct general 2-charge D1-D5 horizon-free non-singular solutions of

solutions are obtained via dualities from F1-P solutions of heterotic and type
IIB on T^4 for the K3 and T^4 cases, respectively. We compute the holographic
data encoded in these solutions, and show that the internal excitations are
captured by vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology of
T^4 or K3. We argue that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of R
ground states determined in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the curves
defining the supergravity solution. We compute vevs of chiral primaries
associated with the middle cohomology and show that they indeed acquire vevs in
the superpositions corresponding to fuzzballs with internal excitations, in
accordance with the holographic results. We also address the question of
whether the fuzzball program can be implemented consistently within

CP violation due to multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields,"  We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN)
mechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a
flavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found
that at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry
are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative
phase between their vacuum expectation values.
  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation
values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the
angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal

separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit
mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging
techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.
  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons
separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude
dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is
shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and
optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part

"AKARI Detection of the Infrared-Bright Supernova Remnant B0104-72.3 in
  the Small Magellanic Cloud","  We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant
(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)
onboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four
observed IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,
optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative
SNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared
waveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the
infrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible
contributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged
SNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our
results highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,
especially for diagnosing SNR shocks.

"Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified
  polymers","  Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insoluble
base materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine
the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such
polymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with
the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme
blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a
polymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the
synthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation
of such systems.

"On second order shape optimization methods for electrical impedance
  tomography","  This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering
the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.

molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field
approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual
contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail,
with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular
orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in
which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure
the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes.
However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a
classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear
interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to
infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent
interference minima.

Gravitational Wave Signals from Chaotic System: A Point Mass with A Disk,"  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a
point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in
this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.

"Timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the Seyfert galaxy
  NGC 3783","  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have
suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We
find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating

momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum
account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of
the transmitted image.

positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also
derive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,
and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in

Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance,"  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)

$p$-Adic Haar multiresolution analysis,"  In this paper, the notion of {\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} is

equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is
the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be

Diatomic molecule as a quantum entanglement switch,"  We investigate a pair entanglement of electrons in diatomic molecule, modeled
as a correlated double quantum dot attached to the leads. The low-temperature
properties are derived from the ground state obtained by utilizing the
Rejec-Ramsak variational technique within the framework of EDABI method, which
combines exact diagonalization with ab initio calculations. The results show,
that single-particle basis renormalization modifies the entanglement-switch
effectiveness significantly. We also found the entanglement signature of a
competition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases.

Quantifying social group evolution,"  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.
Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

Finite bias visibility of the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer,"  We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of
interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of
low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe
structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is
quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical
method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits
the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic
character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the
impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.

The dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds,"  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving
through a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the

graviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and can
therefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We present
results for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes in

Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement,"  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled
state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

Energy conservation and Onsager's conjecture for the Euler equations,"  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for
incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate
energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for
velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the
Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by
local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to
$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.

the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The
coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the

dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the
tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a
collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of
freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom
position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The

Local de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions,"  We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be a
nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state
of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term
``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,
the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.

terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,
and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical
constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of
extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded
microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary
surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and
complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular

possessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thin
nature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the

ionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio
is displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the
dust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central
AGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large

Collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market,"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different
markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations
in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging
market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to
developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to
be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.

from the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in
the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent
classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to
local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription

supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed

Tri-layer superlattices: A route to magnetoelectric multiferroics?,"  We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an
alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form
magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the
superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical
polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric
component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and
``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are
compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active
ferroelectric ions.

Testing outer boundary treatments for the Einstein equations,"  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are
compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an
outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using
different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution
obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each
boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and
extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These
tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein
equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are
reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the
incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the
constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather
different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial
compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here
combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the
Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.

D-brane Instantons on the T^6/Z_3 orientifold,"  We give a detailed microscopic derivation of gauge and stringy instanton
generated superpotentials for gauge theories living on D3-branes at
Z_3-orientifold singularities. Gauge instantons are generated by D(-1)-branes
and lead to Affleck, Dine and Seiberg (ADS) like superpotentials in the
effective N=1 gauge theories with three generations of bifundamental and
anti/symmetric matter. Stringy instanton effects are generated by Euclidean
ED3-branes wrapping four-cycles on T^6/\Z_3. They give rise to Majorana masses
in one case and non-renormalizable superpotentials for the other cases. Finally
we determine the conditions under which ADS like superpotentials are generated
in N=1 gauge theories with adjoints, fundamentals, symmetric and antisymmetric

"Viscoplastic Properties and Tribological Behavior of Diamond-Like Carbon
  Films Using Nanoindentation and Nanoscratch Tests","  Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate various
tribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either friction
coefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high friction
coefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseous
environment, hydrogen content of the film [1], and on its viscoplastic
properties [2,3]. A relation between superlow friction in UHV and
viscoplasticity has indeed been established for a-C:H films and confirmed for a
fluorinated sample (a-C:F:H). In this study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch
tests were conducted in ambient air, using a nanoindentation apparatus, in
order to evaluate tribological behaviors, as well as mechanical and

"New Close Binary Systems from the SDSS-I (Data Release Five) and the

close binary systems observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through Data
Release Five. We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs in
cataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of
cataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample
of close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic
variables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic
white dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,
would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are
similar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average
field strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of
these systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.
Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic
white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the
properties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the
presumed close binary progenitors.

Dynamical Casimir effect for gravitons in bouncing braneworlds,"  We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter
spacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical brane
which first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedes
from it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generated
gravitons are calculated. We show that the massless gravitons have a blue
spectrum and that their energy density satisfies the nucleosynthesis bound with
very mild constraints on the parameters. We also show that the Kaluza-Klein
modes cannot provide the dark matter in an anti-de-Sitter braneworld. However,
for natural choices of parameters, backreaction from the Kaluza-Klein gravitons
may well become important. The main findings of this work have been published

Spectral analysis of Swift long GRBs with known redshift,"  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift

"The Relationship Between Molecular Gas Tracers and Kennicutt-Schmidt
  Laws","  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the
correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

Friedmann equation in various theories of gravity, including the Einstein,

that the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent

Heavy-Light Semileptonic Decays in Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory,"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light
pseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory
(\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark
mass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar
corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered
(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially
quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of
non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the
light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.

"A density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics: retrieving the
  noise","  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that
recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was
stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet
it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we
give a simple proof of those overlooked results.

claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently
that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication
by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion
results claimed in the original paper.

"Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the
  R-mode Instability","  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the
spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

Quantum Auctions,"  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids
and distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum
state gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the
superposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use
entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the
quantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a
suitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to
game the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that

Geometric Phase and Superconducting Flux Quantization,"  In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized
in units of $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$. It is well known from the theory of
Josephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave

additional phase shift of $\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of
geometric phase.
  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and
pure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that the
phase shift of $\pi$ follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and
is thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.

statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant
computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and

opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.

there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $

boundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition
is that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $

map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address

Jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries,"  Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter
from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,
called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of
the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion
star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.
In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with
particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The
case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some
detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type
of objects will be presented.

The Na I D resonance lines in main sequence late-type stars,"  We study the sodium D lines (D1: 5895.92 \AA; D2: 5889.95 \AA) in late-type
dwarf stars. The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between
0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained
medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian
observatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since
1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in
flux stars of unknown colour.

through an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-induced
transparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to a
reduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift of
Aharonov-Bohm type.

3-D Simulations of Ergospheric Disk Driven Poynting Jets,"  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole
magnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux
dominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the
ergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified
limit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the
ergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for
greatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux
that is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of
electromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux
threading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading
the equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central
engine of powerful FRII quasars.

"Position-Velocity Diagrams for the Maser Emission coming from a
  Keplerian Ring","  We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in
Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption
coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with
the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated
position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy
NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object
the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the
inner edge of the ring.

start in a U(1) spin liquid phase proximate to Neel phase and explore possible

process of monopole condensation. Electromagnetic duality is used to rewrite
the theory in terms of monopoles. For spin 1 we find several candidate phases
of which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallel
Haldane chains. For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins
organized into parallel ladders. As a by-product, we also write a Landau theory
of the ordering in two special classical frustrated XY models on the cubic

our approach maps to a dimer model with 2S dimers coming out of every site, and
we find the same spin solid phases in this regime as well.

for the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected
relative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence
turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the
Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina
models. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to
main-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss
theoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the
inclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb
interactions may be partly responsible.
  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent
and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,
consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue
straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or
RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at
large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that
the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density
structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually
low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of
this, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the

in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a
variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that
kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical
current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.

where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for

than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions
entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or

manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D

Growing Perfect Decagonal Quasicrystals by Local Rules,"  A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show
that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling
layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to
form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting
in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect
only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal
quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,
contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

Extrasolar scale change in Newton's Law from 5D `plain' R^2-gravity,"  Galactic rotation curves and lack of direct observations of Dark Matter may
indicate that General Relativity is not valid (on galactic scale) and should be
replaced with another theory. There is the only variant of Absolute Parallelism
which solutions are free of arising singularities, if D=5 (there is no room for
changes). This variant does not have a Lagrangian, nor match GR: an equation of
`plain' R^2-gravity (ie without R-term) is in sight instead. Arranging an
expanding O_4-symmetrical solution as the basis of 5D cosmological model, and
probing a universal_function of mass distribution (along very-very long the
extra dimension) to place into bi-Laplace equation (R^2 gravity), one can
derive the Law of Gravitation: 1/r^2 transforms to 1/r with distance (not with

The Low CO Content of the Extremely Metal Poor Galaxy I Zw 18,"  We present sensitive molecular line observations of the metal-poor blue
compact dwarf I Zw 18 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer.
These data constrain the CO J=1-0 luminosity within our 300 pc (FWHM) beam to
be L_CO < 1 \times 10^5 K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1), an order of
magnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has
a CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC
1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its
B-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf
starburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the
star formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas
forms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must
have a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value. We detect

A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version),"  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of
elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that
this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

the inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings
are exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly
affects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates
strongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the
mechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)
quantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we
discuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject
to external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the
experimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin
relaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon
emission.

"The IDV source J1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation?","  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,
known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming

extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like
planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass
exo-planets.

First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES
spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O
distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first
neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These

the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr
for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond
buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred
octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles
between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three

models are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The
continuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and
solved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expected
properties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves as
pressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. The
modifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values of
a L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relative

form H = H0 + g H1. Here H0 is an interacting Hamiltonian characterized by
conservation laws which lead to an infinite conductivity for g=0. The small
perturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finite
temperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentum
is conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describe
the effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds for
the relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematically
using the memory matrix formalism. Furthermore, we discuss various applications
and investigate under what conditions our lower bound may become exact.

Non-extensive thermodynamics of 1D systems with long-range interaction,"  A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive
energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the
statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive
multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin
chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical
expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the
limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found
to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).

"NMR evidence for a strong modulation of the Bose-Einstein Condensate in

spin 1/2 dimer compound BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ in the magnetic field range 13-26 T and
at temperatures as low as 50 mK. NMR data in the gapped phase reveal that below

($\Delta_{\rm{B}}/\Delta_{\rm{A}}$ = 1.16) exist in every second plane along
the c-axis, in addition to a planar incommensurate (IC) modulation. $^{29}$Si
spectra in the field induced magnetic ordered phase reveal that close to the
quantum critical point at $H_{\rm{c1}}$ = 23.35 T the average boson density
$\bar{n}$ of the Bose-Einstein condensate is strongly modulated along the

$\bar{n}_{\rm{A}}/\bar{n}_{\rm{B}} \simeq 5$. An IC modulation of the local

"Bibliometric statistical properties of the 100 largest European
  universities: prevalent scaling rules in the science system","  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical
properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field
citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative
advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance
universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations
with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and
average journal impact.

On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants,"  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants
(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks,"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are
investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.

33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric
parallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we
converted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy
distribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure
hydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of
effective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are
estimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons

  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.
Using the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to
constrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is
most likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white
dwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared
due to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.

Model C critical dynamics of random anisotropy magnets,"  We study the relaxational critical dynamics of the three-dimensional random
anisotropy magnets with the non-conserved n-component order parameter coupled
to a conserved scalar density. In the random anisotropy magnets the structural
disorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of random
orientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges
of the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties
coincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder
gives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We
investigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group
analysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain
quantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of
the order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios
for the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.

Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

carried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the
AUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor
agreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and
strengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for
resonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance
strengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than
our estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%
(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between
the calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly
to the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in
the experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our

to form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between

Extragalactic Radio Sources and the WMAP Cold Spot,"  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS

independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in
extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are
physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly
nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from
structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need
for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain
the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen
statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single

a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This
is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds
to the anomalies seen in the CMB.

Smooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields,"  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and

tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal
arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass
grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

Domain wall switching: optimizing the energy landscape,"  It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way to
increase media density without causing thermal instability

Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of
the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching
field, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2
for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches
have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this
formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can
be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess
et al comes very close to this limit.

"The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. IX. Exoplanets
  orbiting HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287","  The HARPS high-resolution high-accuracy spectrograph is offered to the
astronomical community since the second half of 2003. Since then, we have been
using this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample of
Solar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-mass
companions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase
the number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to
improve our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain
better constraints for planet-formation models.
  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital
solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The
radial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1
M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital
fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a
long-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric
orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.
The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal
temporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We
find clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile
variations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.

Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks,"  Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties
in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties
in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the
recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the
case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of
the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by
graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with
respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.
This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.
Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical
constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the
Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

"Interactions, superconducting $T_c$, and fluctuation magnetization for
  two coupled dots in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary

dots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimes
between Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammatic
approach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacing
we obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. It
turns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's
function can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use this
information to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has an
attractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the
other is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find that
the critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second
dot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuation
magnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in this
regime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from the
cooperon scaling function.

Z^0 \to 2\gamma and the Twisted Coproduct of the Poincar\'{e} Group,"  Yang's theorem forbids the process $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ in any Poincar\'{e}
invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transform
under the Poincar\'{e} group in the standard way (under the standard coproduct
of the Poincar\'{e} group). This is an important result as it does not depend
on the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutative
geometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. We
prove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.
This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As
an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0
\to \nu + \nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the
Poincar\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not
conserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle
of spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same
helicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.

"Lower order terms in the 1-level density for families of holomorphic
  cuspidal newforms","  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the
conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

A Symplectic Test of the L-Functions Ratios Conjecture,"  Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averages
over a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functions
Ratios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many
problems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and
moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing
agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;
however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.
These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios
Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We
test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic
family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental
discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate
all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect
agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show
agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this

Cosmology from String Theory,"  We explore the cosmological content of Salam-Sezgin six dimensional
supergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitative
agreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis
abundances, and recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The
carrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence
field slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is
a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold
dark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the
quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).
However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold
dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter
energy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of
supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure
constant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)
``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)
the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a
Robertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,
we present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensional
cosmological solution to ten dimensions.

"The Isophotal Structure of Early-Type Galaxies in the SDSS: Dependence

activity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-type
galaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006). We find that the fraction
of disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large
sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear
relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the
isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations
between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the
optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group
hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be
accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy
luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,
nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape
of early-type galaxies.

"On the Origin of the Dichotomy of Early-Type Galaxies: The Role of Dry
  Mergers and AGN Feedback","  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large
N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

"Quantum and Classical Spins on the Spatially Distorted Kagome Lattice:
  Applications to Volborthite","  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\'e lattice, of corner
sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed

between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA

first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear

algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding

radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean

brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to
date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We

disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it
from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)
observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating
disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image
the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular
gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-
or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

Spectroscopy of Nine Cataclysmic Variable Stars,"  We present optical spectroscopy of nine cataclysmic binary stars, mostly
dwarf novae, obtained primarily to determine orbital periods Porb. The stars
and their periods are LX And, 0.1509743(5) d; CZ Aql, 0.2005(6) d; LU Cam,
0.1499686(4) d; GZ Cnc, 0.0881(4) d; V632 Cyg, 0.06377(8) d; V1006 Cyg,
0.09903(9) d; BF Eri, 0.2708804(4) d; BI Ori, 0.1915(5) d; and FO Per, for
which Porb is either 0.1467(4) or 0.1719(5) d.
  Several of the stars proved to be especially interesting. In BF Eri, we
detect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1
subclass, which leads to a distance estimate of approximately 1 kpc. However,
BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary
parallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an
upper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and
it appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have
strong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a
magnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places
it squarely within the 2- to 3-hour ""gap"" in the distribution of cataclysmic
binary orbital periods.

Conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions,"  The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a
quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps.
Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that
contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In
this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of
DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the
new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our

Displacement of the Sun from the Galactic Plane,"  We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement of
the Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods.
The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with
log(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB stars
observed up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. We
decompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigating
the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in
the heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We
found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and
~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained
due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such
deviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of
56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OB
stars respectively.

Correlation amplitude and entanglement entropy in random spin chains,"  Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization,
and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ
spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the
average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon
l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)
power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

"IR observations of MS 1054-03: Star Formation and its Evolution in Rich
  Galaxy Clusters","  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03
at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400
galaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are
selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

"Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed
  Consensus","  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the
gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black

appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are
provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal
gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole
solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their
relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the

every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate

characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle
gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically
distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a
process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.

Simultaneous Swift and REM monitoring of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005,"  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and
November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

On the orbital period of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable HS 0922+1333,"  Context: The object HS 0922+1333 was visited briefly in 2002 in a mini survey

luminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that short
observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar
(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin
period appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations
of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic
and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of
radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and
brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:
New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital
and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of
confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission
line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.

Nova Geminorum 1912 and the Origin of the Idea of Gravitational Lensing,"  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a

the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also

Upper bounds on entangling rates of bipartite Hamiltonians,"  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a
non-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given a
bipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the
entangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is
the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator
norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the
initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct
Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large
multiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional
measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent
state with a state evolving unitarily.

"Criteria in the Selection of Target Events for Planetary Microlensing
  Follow-Up Observation","  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for
planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the
lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we
consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim
10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars
with magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.

Magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks,"  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of
protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

X-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms
pulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution
shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise
and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$
modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$
duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed
emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =
1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The
total 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.

"Vortex-induced topological transition of the bilinear-biquadratic
  Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice","  The ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular
lattice with the the bilinear-biquadratic interaction is studied by Monte Carlo
simulations. It is shown that the model exhibits a topological phase transition
at a finite-temperature driven by topologically stable vortices, while the spin
correlation length remains finite even at and below the transition point. The
relevant vortices could be of three different types, depending on the value of
the biquadratic coupling. Implications to recent experiments on the triangular
antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$ is discussed.

A Topological Glass,"  We propose and study a model with glassy behavior. The state space of the
model is given by all triangulations of a sphere with $n$ nodes, half of which
are red and half are blue. Red nodes want to have 5 neighbors while blue ones
want 7. Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed to
be positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacent
triangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this system
has an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show that
the stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape and
show that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally,
we show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas with
spontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.

"Anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon
  nanotubes","  Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have
studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon
nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the
atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure
derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a
constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The
intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of
the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs
frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to
D2h then to C2h.

"Distribution of the molecular absorption in front of the quasar
  B0218+357","  The line of sight to the quasar B0218+357, one of the most studied lensed
systems, intercepts a z=0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into two
main components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3'', and gives rise to molecular
absorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in
front of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other
velocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this
question, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the
commissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a
function of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed
us to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.
Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of
the HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the
quasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.

"Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to
  extragalactic cosmic rays","  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in
the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the
ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

Daemons and DAMA: Their Celestial-Mechanics Interrelations,"  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged
Planckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by
the St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here
the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric
acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial
accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of
rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to
gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields
adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and
show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of
tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general
relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of
equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of
gravitational energy.

"A kind of prediction from string phenomenology: extra matter at low
  energy","  We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises from
orbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and the
phenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular,
trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the
Heterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP
experiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of
three families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies
on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,
together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an
interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable
lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined
with other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled
way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear
when fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with
several Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that
viable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.

Evidence for a Massive Protocluster in S255N,"  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of
active star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We
present mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the
evolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and
spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm
water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is
clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm
continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are
dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core
(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region
and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1
also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young
hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further
multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the
northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely
traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct
evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface.
Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated
with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with
sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting,
the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized
by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling,
and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming
nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at
premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence
during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization,
where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree
of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on
the size of nanoparticle.

which violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating

Brane World Black Rings,"  Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from a
Randall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. To
this end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensional
black ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world with
a single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five
dimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The
bulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are
constructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black
ring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk
geodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS
horizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as a
limit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.
